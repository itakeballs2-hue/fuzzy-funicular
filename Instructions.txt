Just go in config.json and edit the rpc according to your needs.
don't edit anything other then config.json. if you edit anything else then the code might stop working or break.
after editing the config.json and saving it. just open cmd and do these commands-

npm i
node index.js

after running these commands it will ask you for your discord token in the console. paste your token and press enter.
your rpc will start working.

i suggest doing this in a free code hosting like on https://bot-hosting.net

enjoy!
